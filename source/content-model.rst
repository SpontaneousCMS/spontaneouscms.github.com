The Content Model
=================

The most important thing to understand to either use or develop with
Spontaneous is the content model.

A site is composed of a set of :ref:`pages`, :ref:`boxes`, :ref:`pieces` &
:ref:`fields`.

.. _pages:

Pages
^^^^^

A site is built of a set of **Pages**. These are nested hierarchically below the
site's homepage (which sits at the root of your site with a path of "/" e.g.
'http://example.com/').

Each page has a specific content type. This defines its fields and its list of
:ref:`boxes`. For more information about these see
:ref:`types`).


.. _boxes:

Boxes
^^^^^

Each page contains a certain number of **Boxes**. These are where you enter the
list of :ref:`pieces` (or :ref:`pages`) that make up the contents of a particular
page (or children of the page).

Each box type has a specific list of what can be inserted into it.
