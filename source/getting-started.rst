Getting Started
==================================


.. _urls:

URLs
----

Each page has a minimally a title and custom 'slug' or URL path component. If
nothing else has been set then the slug is automatically generated from the
page's title. So a page with the title "About Us" will have an automatically
generated slug "about-us".

Although the slug is generated the first time, it is always editable so you are
completely in control of your site's URLs.
